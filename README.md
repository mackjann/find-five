# find5

Welcome to 'find5', a mobile application built with React Native, Expo, Firebase, and Typescript, that allows footballers to connect with each other and play!

To run this project fork and clone this repo, run 'npm i' and 'expo start' from your IDE of choice. From the Expo dashboard you can run 'find5' on either an emulator, or your mobile phone via Expo Go.

We would recommend running the application on an android emulator if possible. This app was created in 8 days by a team using a variety of devices, so we primarily used an andoid emulator in the design process. While 'find5' will run on iOS or an android phone via Expo Go, some functionality may be missing and design may be impacted.
